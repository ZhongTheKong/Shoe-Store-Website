	  <h3> Shoe Juggler </h3>
	  <p> As a shoe juggler, you must be able to juggle shoes in all areas of the store. Your presence in the store helps create an environment of peace, joy, and safety. Without 
	  shoe jugglers, Guoyi's Foot Helmets would not be where it is today. Clown makeup is optional but is highly recommended and enjoyed by customers. </p>
	  <p> During your time as a shoe juggler, you will be able to move from a competitive salary all the way up to minimum wage. We do not expect you to be perfect on your first 
	  day and we welcome all people interested in juggling shoes. However, if you ever drop one shoe while juggling, we will fire you, fine you, and burn down your home. No pressure.</p>

	  <h3> Levitating Cashier </h3>
	  <p> As a levitating cashier, we expect you to have a fundamental understanding of doing math, giving change, and knowing how to levitate. Please do not lie during your interview 
	  as it becomes extremely obvious when a levitating cashier cannot do simple math. A team member will help teach you how to use the register. </p>
	  <p> It is crucial that you always levitate since a customer could always be watching and our store must make the customer believe that all of our cashiers can only levitate. 
	  Guoyi's Feet Helmets would not be wear it is today if customers did not believe that. In the case of a robbery or other emergency, we expect our cashiers to use their leviation 
	  powers to neutralize the threat and contact our secret cleanup crew. </p>

	  <h3> Customer Service </h3>
	  <p> Joining the customer service team means joining one of the fundamental pillars of our working staff. When assisting customers, make sure to say nothing helpful and to make 
	  the customers wait as long as possible for any answers to any questions they may have. Never look up from your phones, never smile, and never sound interested. Follow these 
	  basic steps and you'll be just as good as the best customer service our stores can offer. </p>
	  <p> Guoyi's Feet Helmets provides protection for our workers to always ensure safety. If a customer happens to be angry or annoyed with your attitude, always remember that we 
	  keep a gun compartment under every desk. If the customer happens to be a demon, you can come to the back of the store where we have some holy water on standby. </p>
